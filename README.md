# SqliExploiter
This is my first self made python project, It is tested with low security levels of bWapp and sqlilab(Less1-4). I tried to make it work with dvwa at the end, but the whole code was getting
very complex so i left it. You can change urls in the last lines of the code and you can enter cookies in the very first function. At the end i lost the motivation to continue that's
why i left this kind of incompleted. I felt this project isn't teaching me anything new, It's just hardcoding payloads. So this time I'll find some new, more interesting project,
maybe a crawler or a dorking tool and work on it
