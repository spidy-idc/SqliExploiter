# SqliExploiter
This is my first self made python project, It is tested with low security levels of bWapp and sqlilab(Less1-4). I tried to make it work with dvwa at the end, but the whole code was getting
very complex so i left it. 
This works with bwapp and sqlilab, In the very end of the code there is a variable calld url, Just paste url of bwapp or sqlilab there. For bwapp it works for low security and for sqlilab it works from less1-4. If you don't have bwapp or sqlilab in localhost, You can also link labs hosted by someone else on heroku or any other hosting service
why i left this kind of incompleted. I felt this project isn't teaching me anything new, It's just hardcoding payloads. So this time I'll find some new, more interesting project,
maybe a crawler or a dorking tool and work on it
